Programming Assignment 2

## Overview
This is my final commit for assignment PA2. It contains 2 classes: a Point class and a Cluster class. The Point class holds a dynamically allocated array of points with an arbitrary number of dimensions. The Cluster class holds a linked list, whose nodes contain point pointers to our points. 

## Compiler
I was working on this project in Xcode. In addition, I don't know if this matters or not, but Xcode automatically created header files of type .hpp instead of .h.
